# app.calculist.io

This repository is the source code that drives [app.calculist.io](https://app.calculist.io/join). The bulk of the JavaScript and CSS in `app/assets` will be migrating to the primary [Calculist repository](https://github.com/calculist/calculist) over time, and this repo will come to depend on that repo. For now, the two repos are separate and there is not yet any dependency between them.
